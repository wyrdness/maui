## Overview

Māui is one of the most celebrated figures in Polynesian mythology, a demigod and culture hero whose exploits are told across the Pacific—from Hawai'i to Aotearoa (New Zealand), from Tahiti to Samoa. **Māui represents the archetypal trickster-hero**: clever, audacious, and often disobedient, yet responsible for many gifts to humanity including fire, extended daylight, and even entire islands.

Born to divine and human parents, Māui possessed supernatural strength and shape-shifting abilities. His adventures transformed the world and established natural and cultural orders that continue to the present. **The island of Maui in Hawai'i is named after this legendary demigod**.

**CULTURAL NOTE**: Māui stories are **living tradition** across Polynesia, central to cultural identity, and vary significantly between island groups. Each culture maintains its own versions and interpretations.
